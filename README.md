This link will take you to the @23:00 timestamp in the video. This is the part of the video lesson where the narrator begins working on Redux. This is a starter repo with all of the React completed so that you can jump right into the Redux portion of the lesson (@23:00 timestamp).

HOW TO USE THIS REPO:

Fork,
Clone,
npm install,
Begin following along with the video lesson starting @23:00 timestamp


NOTES:

@46:15 componentWillMount() should be replaced with componentDidMount()

The two console.log statements near @47:00 and @48:00 may not work depending on how long the server calls take to respond

use UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps() in Posts.js to clear warning
